# Snacks-Project

## Author: Tatyana Cuttino

## Description

My project involves setting up a web API that performs basic CRUD operations on a "snacks" database table using Supabase. Supabase provides a PostgreSQL database and RESTful API out of the box, which is used here to store and manage snack-related data.

## How to Run

Clone the repository: <https://github.com/Tatyanac94/Snacks-Project.git>

Navigate to the project directory: cd [project-directory]

## Installation Command

Install dependencies: npm install

## Set Up Environmental Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project

```SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=your-anon-public-key
PORT=4000
U+29C9
â§‰
## Run the Server

For development with auto-reloading: npm run dev

For production: npm start
