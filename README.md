# Deployed-Snacks-Project

## Author: Tatyana Cuttino

## Description

My project is a comprehensive Snack Management API designed to handle CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for snacks. The API is built using Node.js and Express, and it interacts with a Supabase backend for data storage. The application includes automated testing, modularized routes, and secured access with API key middleware. Itâ€™s deployed on Vercel, ensuring scalable and efficient operation.
